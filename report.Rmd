## Question 1:

First of all, we will load the relevnt packages and data:

```{r}
setwd("C:/Personal/dataWorkshop/ex3/ex3/ex3")
library(igraph)

ga_edgelist <- read.csv("sources/ga_edgelist.csv")

ga_graph <- graph.data.frame(ga_edgelist, directed = F)
V(ga_graph)$size = degree(ga_graph) * 2
plot(ga_graph)
```
We got a graph with the relationships of the characters in Gray Anatomi:

### part a:

#### i. Betweeness

```{r}
betweenness = betweenness(ga_graph)
max_betweenness <- as.numeric(which(max(betweenness) == betweenness))
betweenness
V(ga_graph)[max_betweenness]
```

![image](/images/ga_betweenness.PNG)

Answer: sloan

#### ii. Closeness

```{r}
closeness = closeness(ga_graph)
max_closeness <- as.numeric(which(max(closeness) == closeness))
closeness
V(ga_graph)[max_closeness]
```

![image](/images/ga_closeness.PNG)

Answer: torres

#### iii. Eigencetor

```{r}
evcent <- evcent(ga_graph)$vector
evcent
max_evcent <- as.numeric(which(max(evcent) == evcent))
V(ga_graph)[max_evcent]
```

Answer: karev

### part b:

### Algorithm "Edge Betweenness"

Deviding the vertexs to communities following the algorithm:

```{r}
edge_betweenness_com <- edge.betweenness.community(ga_graph)
```

#### i.

Creating a graph:

```{r}
plot(ga_graph, vertex.color=edge_betweenness_com$membership)
```

![image](/images/ga_edge_betweenness_graph.png)

#### ii.

```{r}
sizes(edge_betweenness_com)
```

Answer: there are 7 communities, with the sizes: 8, 5, 4, 4, 5, 3, 3. (see the image above).

#### iii.

```{r}
modularity(edge_betweenness_com)
```

Answer: modularity = 0.5774221 (see the image above).

### Algorithm "Walktrap"

Deviding the vertexs to communities following the algorithm:

```{r}
walktrap_com <- walktrap.community(ga_graph)
```

#### i.

Creating a graph:

```{r}
plot(ga_graph, vertex.color=walktrap_com$membership)
```

![image](/images/ga_walktrap_graph.png)

#### ii.

```{r}
sizes(walktrap_com)
```

Answer: there are 7 communities, with the sizes: 5, 13, 3, 3, 2, 3, 3. (see the image above).

#### iii.

```{r}
modularity(walktrap_com)
```

Answer: modularity = 0.5147059 (see the image above).

## Question 2:

Again, we will load the relevnt packages and data:

```{r}
# install.packages('Rfacebook')
library('Rfacebook')

fb_token = "EAACEdEose0cBADdzf40ZAJPO3gwSkPor5NBAB7mvAbh56LkvbISyjIj2DExEfZCFtnYSSbY8juZBsZBdoavJEW5zDIPh3ZClKkEZAhx0tfjm84sKonC4iZAyiYyVynuvVyjZBVExH548e0xBOK2kZCN6AgMitZCuyeZAT1UZCDkDU1kDfKkF7iZBaWF5d"
fb_network <- getNetwork(fb_token, format="edgelist")

# write.csv(fb_network, "sources/fb_network.csv")
```

Note: the token for Facebook API is temporary, so we wrote the data on a file so we can use it whenever we want.
We got a graph with the relationships of our friends on facebook:

```{r}
fb_network <- read.csv("sources/fb_network.csv")

fb_graph <- graph.adjacency(fb_network)
V(fb_graph)$size = degree(fb_graph) * 2
plot(fb_graph,edge.arrow.size=0)
```

### part a:

#### i. Betweeness

```{r}
fb_betweenness = betweenness(fb_graph)
fb_betweenness
max_fb_betweenness <- as.numeric(which(max(fb_betweenness) == fb_betweenness))
V(fb_graph)[max_fb_betweenness]
```

![image](/images/fb_betweenness.PNG)

Answer: Barak Yaari

#### ii. Closeness

```{r}
fb_closeness = closeness(fb_graph)
fb_closeness
max_fb_closeness <- as.numeric(which(max(fb_closeness) == fb_closeness))
V(fb_graph)[max_fb_closeness]
```

![image](/images/fb_closeness.PNG)

Answer: Barak Yaari

#### iii. Eigencetor

```{r}
fb_evcent <- evcent(fb_graph)$vector
fb_evcent
max_fb_evcent <- as.numeric(which(max(fb_evcent) == fb_evcent))
V(fb_graph)[max_fb_evcent]
```

Answer: Barak Yaari

### part b:
